## 🎯 What I Learned
- **Implementing interactive sliders and button feedback**
- **Creating reusable custom widgets for a consistent look**
- **Navigating between screens with Navigator.push**
- **Handling unit conversion (cm → m) for accurate BMI math**

## 🎓 Learning Context

 **This app was built while following the https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-flutter-arabic/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNINGOCTA**  
 I completed it as part of my self-paced Flutter learning journey to master:
 - Widget composition & custom UI components
 - State management with `setState`
 - Navigation between screens
 - Responsive layouts using `Expanded`, `Container`, and `Slider`

 **All code is written by me line-by-line** — no copy-paste. I typed, debugged the design (colors, icons, layout tweaks) to reinforce understanding.

**Why share this?**  
Transparency builds trust. This project proves I can **follow structured learning, execute cleanly, and deliver a working app**
